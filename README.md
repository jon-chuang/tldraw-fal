This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [fal](https://fal.ai) and [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev) that demonstrates real-time AI image generation based on drawings in a canvas.

## Getting Started

1. First, you need to add the fal credentials to your environment. The recommended way is to create a `.env.local` file and add the key you obtained from `https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys`:

   ```bash
   FAL_KEY=<key_id>:<key_secret>"
   ```

2. Make sure you install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Now you can run the Next.js project as usual:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Note:** although the commands above use `npm`, feel free to use your preferred package manager,

## What's next?

Real-time image generation is just one of the many cool things you can do with fal. Make sure you:

- Check all the available [Model APIs](https://fal.ai/models)
